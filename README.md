## üß† Who We Are


BRIDGE-LAB brings together researchers and graduate students working at the intersection of: Human-centered Software Engineering, Corporate Computing Education, Future of Work (with AI) and Accessibility and Neurodivergent Inclusion. We aim to generate practical, evidence-based insights to foster better tools, teams, and technologies across academia and industry.

## üî¨ Research Areas

- **Human-centered Software Engineering**: We study how developers interact with tools, teams, and processes, focusing on productivity, usability, and well-being.

- **Corporate Computing Education**: We evaluate and design training programs to improve how companies prepare and develop their technical teams.

- **Future of Work (with AI)**: We investigate how AI is reshaping work environments, roles, and decision-making in the software industry.

- **Accessibility and Neurodivergent Inclusion**: We explore how technology can be made more inclusive, focusing on participatory design and accessibility for neurodivergent professionals.
